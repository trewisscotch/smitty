## Smitty

Smitty is a mail client that allows you to use handlebars like HTML templates. It supports all the things you would expect out a mail client. Internally it uses [mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail) for creation and [premailer](https://github.com/alexdunae/premailer/) for inline css. Generation for Multi-Part messages is all done for you.

Smitty doesn't use everything that is available in handlebars, it only does replacement for variables. What this allows you to do is create nice looking HTML templates in a proper editor, and then do quick search and replace. 

For example, say you wanted to loop over a set of emails and names, inserting a different name for the corresponding email. In your template, you would put {{name}} in the place where you wanted replacement to occur, write your names and email addresses in 'names.txt' and 'emails.txt' respectively, and call smitty like so. Assume your template is in template.hbs.

    ./smitty from@someplace.io emails.txt 'YO {{name}}' template.hbs --vars 'name=names.txt' 
    
Smitty would then loop over each email address in emails.txt, replacing {{name}} with the corresponding name from names.txt. As you can see, variable names in the subject is also supported.

## Content-ID Embedded Images

Smitty includes the ability to generate Content-ID values for attached images and embed the content within the handlebars HTML template in accordance with [RFC2557](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557#page-8). Smitty will generate a Multi-Part email message and search the handlebar HTML template for image references associated with the attached image name.

    ./smitty from@someplace.io emails.txt 'Subject' -a someimage.jpg --cid tempalte.hbs

Smitty will then search through the template and replace references to \<img src="cid:{{someimage.jpg}}"\> with the Content-ID value of the attached image.
